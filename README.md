ngThreeJs
=========

This is a test angular app for ThreeJs. To support AMD, entire app is build on RequireJS.

ThreeJs is the extension for WebGl and its used to create amazing 3D graphics onto the web html.
AngularJs is the leading Single Page application on the html which makes MVC app much more fun.
RequireJs is Asynchronus Module Definition (AMD) which helps load all the required modules simultaneously.


This is my attempt to run an angular application which can render 3D models/environments and load all the required files/modules simultaneously.

Several progress will be added to this.
